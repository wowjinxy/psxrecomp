## sljit — stack-less JIT compiler (Tier-2 in-process overlay backend)

[sljit](https://github.com/zherczeg/sljit) by Zoltan Herczeg, licensed
**BSD-2-Clause**. Vendored at `lib/sljit/` (source `lib/sljit/sljit_src/`,
license `lib/sljit/LICENSE`) and compiled into the runtime as the self-contained
Tier-2 overlay JIT backend (`runtime/src/overlay_sljit.c`). No external toolchain
dependency; sljit auto-detects the host architecture. See `SLJIT.md` (repo root /
workspace) for the backend design.

## JRickey / gba-recomp — verified-enhancement shadow + screen color science

The verified-enhancement QoL layer (`feat/shadow-enhancements`) reuses two
engine-agnostic pieces originally authored by Jrickey in
[JRickey/gba-recomp](https://github.com/JRickey/gba-recomp), licensed
**MIT OR Apache-2.0**, used with permission:

- **`ShadowVerifier`** — the envelope-correlation differential self-check,
  probation auto-gain calibration, and prove/strike/pause state machine.
  Original: `crates/gba-core/src/shadow.rs`.
  This repo: `runtime/src/audio_shadow.c`, `runtime/include/audio_shadow.h`
  (C re-implementation, via the gbarecomp C++ port `src/gba/audio_shadow.*`
  and the snesrecomp C port `runner/src/snes/audio_shadow.*`; the algorithm is
  unchanged).

- **Color-science core** (xyY→XYZ, primaries→matrix, Bradford chromatic
  adaptation, sRGB OETF) used to bake the present-time screen-color LUT.
  Original: `crates/screen/src/{color,profile,lut}.rs`.
  This repo: `runtime/src/color_lut.c`, `runtime/include/color_lut.h`
  (C re-implementation, via the gbarecomp C++ port `src/runtime/color_lut.*`).

### PSX-specific work (ours)

- The **CRT / composite / Trinitron** display panel models in `color_lut.c`
  (the GBA port modelled a handheld LCD; a console scanned out to a TV needs a
  CRT/composite model instead) — SMPTE-C / Trinitron-class phosphor gamuts,
  CRT gamma, black-lift.
- The **SPU float shadow render** (`runtime/src/spu_shadow.c`,
  `runtime/include/spu_shadow.h`): 4-point cubic resampling + float headroom
  re-render of the PS1 SPU ADPCM voice mix, driven from a read-only tap on the
  canon `spu.c` voice state. This is console-specific (the SNES analog re-renders
  the S-DSP; the GBA analog re-renders the MP2K software mixer).
- The tap plumbing in `runtime/src/spu.c` and `runtime/include/spu.h`.

All reuse keeps the original copyright and dual MIT/Apache-2.0 license.
