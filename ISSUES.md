# PSXRecomp v4 — Open Issues

## Issue #1 — Per-card directory load never runs in recomp (Phase 4 blocker)

**Status:** open, root cause narrowed
**Date opened:** 2026-05-03
**Phase:** 4 (BIOS shell + memory-card screen)

### Symptom

Recomp and Beetle both reach the same MEMORY CARD menu screen with the
same correct PSX rendering. **Beetle renders 3 save-block icons in
CARD 1 + 1 face icon in CARD 2; recomp renders zero icons.** The
divergence is the per-card directory load — Beetle reads it from the
on-disk card files, recomp does not.

(Note: the rainbow buttons are the actual PSX BIOS rendering — both
sides have it. Not a bug.)

### Hard data — gate-mode write distribution

Captured side-by-side, both runtimes driven into the memcard screen
with a 240-frame CROSS hold via `press_into_card_view*.py`:

| Mode | Beetle | Recomp | Notes |
|------|--------|--------|-------|
| 0x01 | 122    | 21     | chain reset / BUSY clear |
| 0x02 | **96** | 16     | R-step install (read-step) |
| 0x04 | 2      | 6      | step-3 install |
| 0x08 | 22     | 3      | D-step install (detect) |
| 0x21 | **0**  | **6**  | init+flag — recomp-only path |

R-step (mode 0x02) caller breakdown:

| caller (`ra`) | Beetle | Recomp |
|----|----|----|
| 0xBFC08F28 (icon-load loop) | **40** | **0** |
| 0xBFC09250                  | **16** | **0** |
| 0xBFC08D08                  | 30     | 6     |
| 0xBFC08A0C                  | 8      | 4     |
| 0xBFC08B98                  | 2      | 6     |

**Recomp never reaches the icon-load loop.** That is the divergence.

### What we proved is *not* the cause

- `mem[0x80007520]` ("chain-restart discriminator") is **not** the
  divergence. Both sides have it at 0 in steady state. The earlier
  hypothesis that recomp=0 / Beetle=non-zero at the decision point was
  wrong — both sides clear it in the JAL-delay-slot at PC `0xBFC14CE0`
  (= RAM 0x51E0) every 2 frames before calling `func_00004D6C`.
- The texture corruption on the menu buttons is correct PSX
  rendering, not a bug.
- The per-slot FP table at `mem[0x7528+slot*4]` IS swapped
  dynamically by recomp too (between `0x5B64`, `0x5688`, `0x51F4`) —
  the swap mechanism works. Beetle just performs additional swaps from
  callers `BFC08F28` and `BFC09250` that recomp never reaches.
- `func_00006380` (writes `mem[0x75C0]=1`) and the B-table trampolines
  at `BFC0DA30` / `BFC0DA40` (B0:0x58, B0:0x4D `_card_status`) DO run in
  recomp — `BFC0DA30` 620×, `BFC0DA40` 618×. The trampoline machinery
  works for those.

### Suspected root cause (not yet confirmed)

Recomp **never enters `func_1FC08B3C`** — the per-card directory load
function. The icon-load loop at PC `0xBFC08F1C..0xBFC08F7C` lives
inside this function. The loop does `jal 0xBFC0DA00` (= B0:0x4F
`_card_read`) once per directory entry; Beetle hits this 20× per
session.

Wtrace activity that *appears* to put recomp inside `func_1FC08B3C`
(mode 0x02 writes with `ra=0xBFC08B98`) is reached via the FP-table
swap path, not via the icon loop. The wider function entry at
`label_BFC08B3C` is never logged in `fn_entry_dump` for the entire
[0x1FC08000, 0x1FC0A000) range across 134M captured ring entries.

`func_1FC08B3C` IS in the recomp dispatch table (entry 5449,
`{ 0x1FC08B3Cu, func_1FC08B3C }`) plus 20+ continuation entries. So
the function is recompiled and dispatchable; it's the *caller* that
isn't reaching it.

### Open questions for the next session

1. **What calls `func_1FC08B3C`?** Find the static caller (or callers)
   of ROM `0xBFC08B3C`. Use Ghidra `xrefs 0xBFC08B3C` to enumerate.
2. **Does recomp ever reach `func_000005E0` (B0 dispatcher) and
   `func_000005C4` (A0 dispatcher)?** These live in the recomp
   dispatch table; if recomp doesn't enter them, B-table dispatch is
   broken. Was about to check this when the runtime froze on a
   270M-entry `fn_entry_dump`.
3. **Counter-mismatch hypothesis:** in `func_00004D6C`, the FP-call
   chooses between several outcomes based on `mem[0x7514]`-1.
   `func_00005B64` (the dispatcher FP) returns -1 when counter=0,
   forcing the 0x21 path. Both sides clear `mem[0x7514]` in the same
   place every 2 frames, but Beetle's writes show counter cycles
   1-2-3-4-5-6 inside a single window (132 cycles × 6 calls), while
   recomp's data showed cycles up to 13 with different clear sources.
   The cycle structure differs — needs deeper analysis.

### Diagnostic infrastructure built / fixed this session

- `tools/summarize_gate_modes.py` — tallies gate writes by value
  (mode 0x01/0x02/0x04/0x08/0x21) per caller, recomp + beetle
- `tools/_dump_gate_seq.py` — dump gate writes in seq order with
  `pc/fn/ra/w` fields (extends earlier handoff tool)
- `tools/_dump_addrs.py` — group wtrace by addr, show distinct
  writers per addr
- `tools/_dump_7520_beetle.py` — filter beetle wtrace by addr range
- `tools/_dump_ram_words.py` — RAM dump as 4-byte words, both backends
- `tools/_read_7520.py` — sample mem[0x7520], 0x755A, 0x7568
- `tools/_screenshot_meta.py` — call screenshot/screenshot_file/
  emu_screenshot
- `tools/check_pc_dispatch.py` — group `fn_entry_dump` by `func_addr`
  in a range
- `tools/press_into_card_view_recomp.py` — mirror Beetle's
  press_into_card_view but for recomp
- `tools/arm_gate_trace.py` extended with `[0x7520..0x7524)`,
  `[0x7514..0x7518)`, `[0x7528..0x7538)`, `[0x7258..0x7260)` ranges

### Tooling fix needed (CLAUDE.md Rule 15)

`fn_entry_dump` iterates the entire ring (up to 270M entries) before
applying the addr filter, which **freezes the debug server thread for
seconds-to-minutes** on a populated ring. Both `handle_fn_entry_dump`
and `handle_fn_exit_dump` in `runtime/src/debug_server.c` need the
addr filter applied early, plus a `seq_lo/seq_hi` window cap, so a
filtered query for a small range returns immediately.

### Files with new memories on disk

- `memory/MEMORY.md` (will be updated next session with the
  "0x7520 is NOT the divergence — directory-load function never
  entered" finding)

### Update 2026-05-03 (continued)

**Static call chain to the directory load (via Ghidra xrefs):**

```
????
  -> FUN_bfc24640 / FUN_bfc24a48 / FUN_bfc1cdd8       (3 of the 5 _card_load callers)
       jal 0xB005A9B0  (= jal 0xBFC42BB0 = B0:0x15 _card_load)
  -> FUN_bfc0dac0  (kernel B0:0x15 trampoline body)
       jr $t2 with $t1=0x15 → kernel B0 dispatcher
  -> _card_load (B0:0x15 body in kernel image)
       calls FUN_bfc09914
  -> FUN_bfc09914
       FUN_bfc08b3c(0)   ; load card-1 directory
       FUN_bfc08b3c(0x10); load card-2 directory
  -> FUN_bfc08b3c (the icon-load loop at BFC08F1C..BFC08F7C)
       jal 0xBFC0DA00  (= B0:0x4F _card_read)  per directory entry
```

**On recomp NONE of `FUN_bfc24640`, `FUN_bfc24a48`, `FUN_bfc1cdd8`,
`FUN_bfc09914`, `FUN_bfc08b3c`, `FUN_bfc0c2e8` are ever called.**
The shell never reaches the call sites. Per
`memory/phase4_b0_trampoline_findings.md`: "The shell has a conditional
code path for card init. On DuckStation, the shell enters the card
detection path. In our runtime, this condition fails, so card init is
skipped." This is the same blocker.

**Static caller of FUN_bfc0c2e8 (BootInitMemcards) is NOT static.** It
has zero static xrefs, and the literal `0xBFC0C2E8` does not appear
anywhere in ROM. It's invoked via a kernel function pointer table
populated at runtime.

**Update late 2026-05-03 — actual call path identified via Beetle
fn_trace:**

Beetle's fn_trace ring (with `0x1FC09914` armed as a target) captures:
- `seq=904 JR caller=0x000005D8 ra=0x8003202C` jumping to FUN_bfc09914
- caller PC `0x000005D8` is INSIDE the kernel A0/B0 dispatcher area
  (A0 dispatcher entry is `0x000005C4`, B0 dispatcher is `0x000005E0`)
- `ra=0x8003202C` means the JAL that started this chain was at
  `0x80032024` — which translates to ROM `0xBFC1A024`
- Disassembly at ROM 0xBFC1A024:
  ```
  bfc1a000: li $t8, 1
  bfc1a004: bne $t9, $zero, 0xbfc1a040  ; SKIP if already initialized
  bfc1a008:   sw $t8, -0x5880($at)       ; (delay slot) set init flag
  bfc1a00c: jal 0xb005a960               ; B0:0x4A InitCARD($a0=1)
  bfc1a010:   li $a0, 1
  bfc1a014: jal 0xb005a970               ; B0:0x4B StartCARD($a0=0)
  bfc1a018:   nop
  bfc1a01c: jal 0xb005a980               ; B0:0x5B ChangeClearPad
  bfc1a020:   clear $a0
  bfc1a024: jal 0xb005a990               ; A0:0x70 (_card_load equivalent)
  bfc1a028:   nop
  bfc1a02c: jal 0xb005a9a0               ; A0:0xAD
  bfc1a030:   li $a0, 1
  bfc1a034: li $t0, 1
  bfc1a038: lui $at, 0x8006
  bfc1a03c: sw $t0, 0x66f8($at)          ; mark mem[0x800666F8]=1 (init done)
  bfc1a040: lw $ra, ...
  ```
- Shell calls `jal 0xB005A990` at PC `0xBFC1A024`. The trampoline at
  `0xBFC42990` is **A0:0x70**, which the kernel A-table dispatches to
  `FUN_bfc09914` (the directory loader caller).
- So the actual chain is **A0:0x70**, not B0:0x15. The 5 static
  callers of `FUN_bfc0c2e8` (FUN_bfc24640 etc.) are red herrings —
  they handle COPY/DELETE actions, not boot-time card load.

**Recomp blocker:** the shell function `FUN_bfc1a000` is reached via
indirect dispatch (no static caller in ROM). It is in recomp's
dispatch table (`{0x1FC1A000u, func_1FC1A000}`), but the shell never
dispatches to it. OR — the shell DOES dispatch to it, but the
`bne $t9, $zero, 0xBFC1A040` branch at PC 0xBFC1A004 skips the init
because `$t9 != 0` somehow.

**Confirmed already-known issue.** This matches
`memory/phase4_b0_trampoline_findings.md`: "The shell has a
conditional code path for card init. ... In our runtime, this
condition fails, so card init is skipped and the shell goes directly
to the main menu (state 0x37)."

### Concrete next step

1. Find what calls `FUN_bfc1a000` on Beetle. Arm `0x1FC1A000` in
   Beetle fn_trace and capture the caller. (One JAL produces the
   chain.)
2. On recomp, check whether `func_1FC1A000` is ever entered. If yes:
   capture `$t9` value at entry. If $t9!=0, find what set it.
   If no: trace the upstream call chain to find why the JAL to
   `func_1FC1A000` doesn't fire.
3. Fix the recompiler's emit / generator for whatever instruction or
   branch is producing the divergent state. NEVER hand-patch the
   generated code or hand-call `func_1FC1A000`.

### Update 2026-05-03 (continued, late session)

**Step 1's address range was wrong** — `0x1FC1A000` is a label
INSIDE `func_1FC19FD0`, not the function entry. Querying for the
correct entry `0x1FC19FD0` shows recomp DOES enter:
- `func_1FC19FD0` (BootInitMemcardsShell) at frame 617/2344 with
  `$a0=0x00F000F0` (matches the AND-mask gate at BFC19FDC).
- The full init chain runs: `mem[0x800666F8]` (init done flag) is set
  to `1`, meaning all 5 inner JALs (InitCARD, StartCARD,
  ChangeClearPad, A0:0x70, A0:0xAD) executed.
- `FUN_bfc09914` is entered at frame 617/2344 with `$a0=0`
  (`ra=0x8003202C` — confirming the JAL chain from BootInitMemcardsShell).
- `FUN_bfc08b3c` is entered **12 times** across both slots:
  frame 2344/2350 (initial calls from FUN_bfc09914 with `ra=BFC09934`,
  `BFC0993C`), then frames 2372/2385/2426/2433 (subsequent calls from
  `FUN_bfc089c0` `ra=BFC08A90`).

**Beetle fn_trace confirms the call chain**:
```
JALR @ 0x8004673C → 0x80031FD0 (BootInitMemcardsShell)
  $a0=0x00F000F0, $a1=0x00F000F0, ra=0x80030968
```
The caller PC `0x8004673C` is inside a function at shell-RAM
`0x800466B8` (= ROM `0xBFC2E6B8`), entered via `JAL` from PC
`0x80030960`. The function reads a function-pointer table at
`mem[$a3 + idx*0x88 + 0x34]` and dispatches devices. For card
init, `$t2` = pointer to BootInitMemcardsShell. Recomp ALSO reaches
this function (per `func_1FC2E6B8` having entries) — the BIOS shell
init chain IS running on recomp end-to-end.

**The actual root cause is one level deeper.** `FUN_bfc08b3c`
runs but **bails out in the 15-sector init loop before reaching the
icon-load loop** at PC `0xBFC08F1C..BFC08F7C`:

- `_card_read` (B0:0x4F via trampoline `BFC0DA00`) is called 32 times
  on recomp — `ra=BFC08B98` (sector 0 from FUN_bfc08b3c entry),
  `ra=BFC08D08` (sectors 1+ from the 15-sector loop), `ra=BFC08A0C`
  (FUN_bfc089c0's first read).
- Sector 0 read SUCCEEDS — `mem[0xA000BE48]` shows `'M' 'C' 0 0 …
  0 0 0 0x0E` — the MC magic AND a valid XOR checksum (XOR of bytes
  0..126 = 0x0E = byte 127). The buffer is correctly filled by
  recomp's SIO/card simulation for sector 0.
- The 15-sector loop runs only ~4 iterations per slot before bailing
  to `LAB_bfc08f8c`. Confirmed: `mem[0xA000B9E8..]=0xFFFFFFFF` is
  exactly the bail-clear pattern (`for (i=0; i<0x14; i++) puVar10[i]=
  0xFFFFFFFF`). And `mem[0xA000BA88]=0` is the bail-clear for the
  directory area.
- The validator `FUN_bfc08720` is **never entered** — confirming the
  bail happens BEFORE the checksum check, in the read-gate:

```c
iVar6 = FUN_bfc0da00(slot, sector, buf);
if ((iVar6 != 1) || (iVar6 = FUN_bfc09144(), iVar6 == 0)) {
    goto LAB_bfc08f8c;          // ← bail
}
iVar6 = FUN_bfc08720(buf);      // ← never called
```

Either:
- (a) `_card_read` returns `!= 1` for sector ≥ 1 (i.e. recomp's SIO
  card simulation only completes sector-0 reads correctly), OR
- (b) `FUN_bfc09144` returns 0 — meaning one of the error flags
  `mem[0xA000B9D4..B9E0]` was set instead of the success flag
  `mem[0xA000B9D0]`. The error flags are set by the recomp's
  SIO IRQ / chain coordinator on read failure.

**Concrete next step (next session):** capture `_card_read` return
values via `fn_exit_dump` of `0x1FC0DA00` while card init is happening
(window from frame ~1029-1100), and capture the wtrace lifecycle of
`mem[0xA000B9D0]` and `mem[0xA000B9D4..B9E0]` during the same window
to determine which flag fires for the failing sector.

**Or simpler**: The fix is in `runtime/src/memcard.c` /
`runtime/src/sio.c`. The SIO/card simulation handles sector 0
correctly but fails on sector ≥ 1. The issue is in hardware
simulation, NOT recompiler/codegen. Inspect how the runtime simulates
the multi-sector read protocol.

**This session's findings invalidate the handoff's primary
hypothesis** (`recomp never enters func_1FC1A000`). The shell init
chain IS reaching directory load. The blocker is the runtime's SIO
card simulation failing sector ≥ 1 reads. Per the handoff: "Cycle-paced
SIO works well enough for card detection. Sector-0 detection works."
That hypothesis is correct, but sector ≥ 1 is the new blocker.

**Failed attempt: 67 trampoline seeds (regressed shell main-menu
transition).** I added all 67 missing A0/B0/C0 trampolines (BFC0D8E0..
BFC0D940, BFC16550..BFC16750, BFC42xxx including BFC42BB0=B0:0x15) to
`recompiler/seeds/dispatch_miss_seeds.json`, regenerated, rebuilt.
Result: recomp never advanced past the MAIN MENU — pressing CROSS no
longer transitioned to the memcard menu. Reverted seeds via
`git checkout HEAD -- recompiler/seeds/`. Conclusion: dispatching the
shell trampolines through recompiled C functions broke shell flow.
The existing dirty_ram_dispatch handles them correctly; do not reseed.

**Tool fix landed:** `runtime/src/debug_server.c::fn_dump_parse` now
defaults to a 1M-entry sliding window instead of the full 128M ring,
preventing the multi-second freeze that previously made `fn_entry_dump`
unusable on populated rings.

### Next session — laser focus

The blocker is "find what kernel/shell function call chain *should*
invoke `FUN_bfc0c2e8` (BootInitMemcards) at boot, and why recomp's
shell skips it." Suggested approach:

1. Find the kernel function pointer table that contains
   `0xBFC0C2E8`. The address must appear *somewhere* — maybe in a
   table populated at runtime by `lui+addiu` instructions in another
   function. Search Ghidra for `BFC0` `C2E8` halfword pairs.
2. Look at SystemInit / boot chain (around `0xBFC00150` reset
   vector). Compare DuckStation/Beetle's static fn_trace through boot
   vs recomp's — find where the divergence first occurs.
3. The goal is a single decision point in shell init code where
   recomp takes the "skip card init" branch and Beetle takes the
   "do card init" branch. Compare register state at that branch.

## Issue #2 — `fn_entry_dump` / `fn_exit_dump` freeze the debug server on populated rings

**Status:** open
**Date opened:** 2026-05-03

`runtime/src/debug_server.c::handle_fn_entry_dump` and
`handle_fn_exit_dump` walk every entry in the 64K-cap ring (or rather
the entire `[seq_lo, seq_hi)` window, which can be the full ring)
applying the addr filter only AFTER constructing the per-entry buffer
position. With 270M cumulative entries and a 1GB output buffer, a
filtered query for a 0x200-byte addr range still iterates 134M
entries before returning anything. Debug server is single-threaded so
all other commands stall (including `ping`).

**Fix:** apply `addr_lo/hi` filter as the first check inside the
loop before any string formatting; cap `seq_hi - seq_lo` to a
sensible default (e.g. 2M) when the caller doesn't pass an explicit
window.

## Issue #3 — BIOS "PlayStation" disc-detected screen is missing the PS logo glyph

**Status:** open
**Date opened:** 2026-05-11
**Phase:** 4 (BIOS shell render)

### Symptom

After the Sony logo, the BIOS shows the second boot screen (the
"PlayStation" disc-detected screen rendered when a disc is present).
On this screen the top region — which on real hardware shows the
stylized PS logo bitmap — is blank. The text below it ("PlayStation",
license string, etc.) renders correctly.

Cosmetic only; boot continues, the disc loads, and Tomba's FMVs start.
Logged here so we don't lose track of it once the FMV cluster is fixed.

### Likely areas

- GPU VRAM upload for the logo bitmap (CopyRectangle / CPU->VRAM
  transfer) may be dropping a region. The other tiles on the same
  screen render, so it isn't a wholesale VRAM/clut wipe.
- Or the logo is sourced from a CD raw-sector / sector-header data
  path that the current `cdrom.c` whole-sector mode doesn't expose
  the way the BIOS expects.

### Concrete next step

Take a Beetle screenshot of the same boot screen as oracle, diff the
VRAM region the logo lives in (Beetle vs recomp at the same frame),
and walk back from the missing pixels via `wtrace` on the source
RAM/VRAM coordinates.

## Issue #5 — Mid-function split targets not registered in dispatch table

**Status:** open, audit-surfaced
**Date opened:** 2026-05-12
**Phase:** platform (recompiler emit, full_function_emitter path)
**Bug class:** same shape as 2026-05-12 jump-table cross-function fix
(`full_function_emitter.cpp:777`).

### Symptom

When the recompiler emits a branch/jump whose target is a
mid-function address (neither a known block in the current CFG nor a
known function start), it emits `call_by_address(cpu, 0xX); return;`
to defer dispatch to the runtime — but does NOT register `0xX` in the
dispatch table. At runtime, the dispatch binary-search misses, the
target page isn't dirty, so `psx_unknown_dispatch` fires.

### Affected emit sites in `recompiler/src/code_generator.cpp`

| Line | Pattern                                                |
|------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| 970  | conditional-branch taken-arm to mid-func target        |
| 981  | conditional-branch fall-through to mid-func target     |
| 998  | unconditional jump to mid-func target                  |

All three should call `register_cross_function_target(branch_target)`
the same way the jump-table emitter does (line 777 of
`full_function_emitter.cpp`).

### Evidence — Tomba audit, 2 manifestations

From `codegen_audit_game.py --config game.toml`:

```
[2] literal call_by_address targets: 333 unique, 459 sites
    dispatch table size: 1921 entries
    targets in declared code regions: 2
    targets in RAM (dirty-RAM interpreter domain): 331
    in-code targets MISSING from dispatch: 2
      0x800905E4  (1 site)
      0x80090600  (1 site)
```

Both addresses appear in `generated/SCUS_942.36_full.c` with comments
`/* taken: split (mid-func) */` and `/* not taken: split (mid-func) */`
— the recompiler EXPLICITLY knows these are mid-function splits but
fails to register them.

The 331 RAM-domain targets are not bugs — they're runtime-loaded
overlays correctly handled by `dirty_ram_dispatch`.

### Concrete next step

1. Add `register_cross_function_target(branch_target)` at the three
   call sites in `code_generator.cpp` (lines 970, 981, 998).
2. Regen Tomba.
3. Re-run `codegen_audit_game.py` — expect "in-code call_by_address
   misses: 0".
4. Re-run on BIOS to confirm no regression.

## Issue #4 — 7 unemitted GTE / COP2 instructions in BIOS Shell code

**Status:** open, audit-surfaced
**Date opened:** 2026-05-12
**Phase:** 4 (BIOS shell render)
**Likely related to:** Issue #3 (missing PS logo on disc-detected screen)

### Symptom

The Phase B1 `gte_audit` (now generic, code-region-filtered) reports
4 missing `gte_execute` emits and 3 missing LWC2/SWC2 emits in the
BIOS Shell code region. None of the affected PCs appear anywhere in
`generated/SCPH1001_full.c`.

| PC          | Word         | Class          |
|-------------|--------------|----------------|
| 0xBFC34FF8  | 0x4A480012   | GTE MVMVA      |
| 0xBFC3502C  | 0x4A480012   | GTE MVMVA      |
| 0xBFC35064  | 0x4A480012   | GTE MVMVA      |
| 0xBFC350C4  | 0x4A480012   | GTE MVMVA      |
| (3 sites)   | LWC2 / SWC2  | GTE load/store |

These were previously masked by 73 data-region false positives in the
old unfiltered tool. The B1 code-region filter surfaced them.

### Likely cause

MVMVA is matrix-vector-multiply-and-add — the BIOS only uses GTE/3D
math in two narrow places: the boot logo intro and the
disc-detected/PlayStation-logo screen. We boot past both, but
**Issue #3's missing PS-logo glyph is consistent with these
unemitted MVMVA + LWC2/SWC2 sites**: if the recompiler skipped the
3D math that draws the logo, the logo would render as nothing or
garbage but the surrounding text would be fine — exactly Issue #3's
symptom.

Two possible root causes (not yet distinguished):
- **Discovery gap:** the function containing these PCs was never
  identified, so nothing got emitted for it.
- **Emit gap:** the function was discovered but the recompiler
  skipped these specific instructions when translating.

### Concrete next step

Check whether ANY PC near `0xBFC34FF8` appears in
`generated/SCPH1001_full.c`. If neighbors are emitted but the GTE
sites aren't, it's an emit gap (fix in code_generator.cpp). If
neighbors are absent too, it's a discovery gap (fix in function
discovery seeds). Either way, then close Issue #3 alongside.
