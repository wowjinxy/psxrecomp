/*
 * interrupts.c — v4 interrupt delivery for recompiled BIOS.
 *
 * Pure hardware simulation. No BIOS state, no HLE, no interpreter.
 *
 * Since recompiled code runs as native C (no per-instruction stepping),
 * interrupt delivery happens at dispatch loop boundaries. The dispatch
 * loop calls psx_check_interrupts() after each function returns.
 *
 * Vblank is fired on a dispatch-count schedule to approximate 60 Hz.
 *
 * ReturnFromException handling:
 *   On real hardware, ReturnFromException (B0:0x17 or SYSCALL(3))
 *   restores the full register context from the TCB and jumps to the
 *   saved EPC.  This effectively "longjmps" out of the exception
 *   handler, bypassing any remaining chain-walk code.
 *
 *   In our recompiled model the exception handler runs as a nested
 *   psx_dispatch call.  A normal function return would unwind only one
 *   frame, leaving the chain walker running with corrupted registers.
 *   We use setjmp/longjmp to model the real hardware behaviour:
 *   psx_check_interrupts sets a jump point before dispatching the
 *   handler, and psx_exception_longjmp() (called by the runtime's
 *   ReturnFromException implementation) longjmps back, unwinding the
 *   entire handler call tree in one step.
