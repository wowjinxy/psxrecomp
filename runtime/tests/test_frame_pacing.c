/*
 * test_frame_pacing.c — validate the race-free pacing decision function.
 *
 * Bug B regression test. The old open-coded pacing loop in
 * sdl_vblank_present read the performance counter twice: once in the
 * while-condition, once to compute remaining time. If the deadline was
 * crossed between the two reads, the unsigned subtraction underflowed
 * and SDL_Delay received (2^64 - delta_ticks)*1000/freq truncated to
 * Uint32 — ~24.7 days at the standard 10 MHz QPC. The replacement,
 * frame_pacing_sleep_ms(), takes a SINGLE counter sample and compares
 * before subtracting, so the underflow is impossible by construction.
 * This test pins that property, including the exact post-deadline
 * sample that froze the app.
 *
 * Build: gcc -I../include -o test_frame_pacing test_frame_pacing.c
 * (includes ../src/frame_pacing.c directly with FRAME_PACING_PURE_ONLY,
 *  which compiles only the SDL-free decision function.)
