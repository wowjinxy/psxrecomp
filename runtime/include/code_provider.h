/* code_provider.h — the backend-agnostic code-production seam (SLJIT.md §3).
 *
 * One interface the overlay capture/dispatch spine talks to instead of calling
 * a specific backend directly. The validated gcc spawn->DLL path becomes its
 * first implementation; the in-process sljit JIT (SLJIT.md §7 step 4) becomes
 * the second. Everything that makes overlays correct — content-keyed multi-
 * candidate dispatch, per-call live-byte validation, the self-mod blacklist,
 * the coverage manifest — is unchanged and backend-blind (SLJIT.md §2).
 *
 * Two production lifecycles, BOTH expressed here because the two backends model
 * production differently and a provider implements whichever it supports:
 *
 *   - BATCH / ASYNC  (request / busy / poll_main): the gcc model. Kicked by the
 *     autocapture tick, spawns a compiler off-thread, applied later via a cache
 *     rescan on the emu thread. Seconds of latency; many fragments per run.
 *   - SYNC / ON-MISS (compile_fragment): the sljit model. JIT a single fragment
 *     in-process at a dispatch miss, sub-ms, return a native fn the caller
 *     registers immediately. Wired into the dispatch path (overlay_loader.c
 *     try_sljit_region); the sljit shard is then VALIDATED via the same-state
 *     diff before it runs live (see SLJIT.md §11 / overlay_loader_dispatch).
 *
 * A provider sets the hooks it supports and leaves the rest NULL; callers
 * null-check before invoking. The gcc provider's batch hooks are thin pass-
 * throughs to autocompile_* — behavior is byte-for-byte what it was before the
 * abstraction (this is a pure refactor; selection defaults to gcc).
