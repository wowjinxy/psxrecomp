/*
 * event_ring.h — Always-on unified event-timeline ring.
 *
 * Purpose: capture the interleaved timeline of interrupt-delivery decisions,
 * I_STAT transitions, and DMA kick/complete events, each tagged with the
 * current guest cycle, PC, enclosing recompiled function, current execution
 * mode (native-overlay / dirty-RAM-interp / static), and the in-progress
 * native overlay function. The goal is to diff two runs of the SAME route
 * (native-overlay OFF vs ON) and find the FIRST interrupt/DMA ordering
 * divergence relative to game code (PRINCIPLES.md #3, handoff Priority 2).
 *
 * Design: ALWAYS-ON (Release too), eviction-bounded ring. Records EDGES /
 * EVENTS, never per-poll samples — native code calls psx_check_interrupts at
 * every block, so polling would evict the window instantly. The interrupt
 * decision path emits an event only when the decision OUTCOME changes
 * (idle -> gated(reason) -> delivered), and raises/DMA are emitted at their
 * source sites. Dump-on-demand; the ring survives a blue screen because the
 * debug-server thread stays alive and queries it.
 *
 * This is OBSERVABILITY, not a fix. It does not alter timing.
