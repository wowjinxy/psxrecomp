/* overlay_sljit — Tier-2 self-contained in-process JIT backend (sljit).
 *
 * Architecture (locked, see SLJIT.md):
 *   Tier 1 (highest) — statically recompiled native (main EXE + discovered
 *                      overlay DLLs). Fastest. Unchanged.
 *   Tier 2 (this)    — the "shard": a fragment recompiled ON THE FLY the first
 *                      time execution would otherwise fall to the interpreter.
 *                      Built in RAM (sljit, sub-ms, no toolchain), registered as
 *                      a native candidate so the NEXT encounter is Tier 2 not
 *                      Tier 3, then persisted so later sessions reload it instead
 *                      of re-discovering through the slow interpreter. This is
 *                      structurally identical to today's gcc capture->compile->
 *                      cache->load path; sljit is just an in-process producer.
 *   Tier 3 (lowest)  — dirty-RAM interpreter (dirty_ram_interp.c). Correctness
 *                      floor for not-yet-discovered code.
 *
 * SAFETY CONTRACT (precision over recall): the emitter compiles only what it can
 * prove it emits identically to the interpreter. The moment it meets any
 * instruction/shape it does not yet support, it ABORTS the whole fragment and
 * returns failure — the caller then runs Tier 3 (interpreter). A partial emitter
 * is therefore always safe: it can never ship a mis-compiled shard, only decline
 * to produce one. gcc remains the default backend; sljit slots in UNDER the
 * proven path and is gated behind backend selection (see overlay_backend.h-style
 * policy below) until it passes the same-state differential.
