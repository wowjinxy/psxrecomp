/*
 * frame_pacing.h — race-free wall-clock frame pacing.
 *
 * Replaces the open-coded pacing loops in main.cpp (sdl_vblank_present)
 * and beetle_main.cpp. The open-coded version read the performance
 * counter twice per iteration (once in the while-condition, once to
 * compute the remaining time); if the deadline was crossed between the
 * two reads — a preemption-sized window — the unsigned subtraction
 * underflowed and SDL_Delay received a ~24.7-day argument (2^64 ticks
 * * 1000 / 10 MHz, truncated to Uint32). That was the Bug B hard
 * freeze: the app parks in one SDL_Delay with every counter frozen,
 * wedged between `i_stat |= VBLANK` and exception delivery.
 *
 * Rules the implementation must keep:
 *   - exactly ONE counter read per decision; compare before subtract
 *   - the computed sleep is clamped to one frame period
 *   - a deadline already in the past never sleeps
