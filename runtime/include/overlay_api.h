/* ABI version exported by every overlay DLL as `overlay_abi()`.  The loader
 * rejects (and deletes, so autocompile regenerates) any DLL whose version
 * doesn't match — including all pre-versioning DLLs, which lack the export.
 *
 * v2: dispatch call-contract (Bug D family) — DLL call sites carry (ra, sp)
 *     contract checks and share the runtime's bail state via the appended
 *     callback pointers below.
 * v3: widescreen backdrop screenX squash ([widescreen.backdrop] x_sites) —
 *     overlay backdrop handlers now emit psx_ws_backdrop_x() at their screenX
 *     store. This is an EMIT-content change (not a struct-ABI change), but the
 *     version is the cache discriminator: bumping it forces the loader to
 *     reject pre-backdrop DLLs so autocompile regenerates them with the squash.
 *     (The deferred follow-up is to auto-derive this tag from a hash of the
 *     widescreen config + emit headers; until then it's a manual bump.) */
