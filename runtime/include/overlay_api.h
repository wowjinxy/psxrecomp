 * rejects (and deletes, so autocompile regenerates) any DLL whose version
 * doesn't match — including all pre-versioning DLLs, which lack the export.
 *
 * v2: dispatch call-contract (Bug D family) — DLL call sites carry (ra, sp)
 *     contract checks and share the runtime's bail state via the appended
 *     callback pointers below.
 * v3: widescreen backdrop screenX squash ([widescreen.backdrop] x_sites) —
 *     overlay backdrop handlers now emit psx_ws_backdrop_x() at their screenX
 *     store. This is an EMIT-content change (not a struct-ABI change), but the
 *     version is the cache discriminator: bumping it forces the loader to
 *     reject pre-backdrop DLLs so autocompile regenerates them with the squash.
 *     (The deferred follow-up is to auto-derive this tag from a hash of the
 *     widescreen config + emit headers; until then it's a manual bump.) */

/* Codegen flavor of the recompiled output the overlays + runtime were built
 * against. Overlays are keyed in the cache by guest-bytes CRC, which is
 * flavor-BLIND — the same guest overlay yields the same filename whether it was
 * compiled by the base recompiler or a variant (e.g. widescreen, which emits
 * extra runtime symbols + GTE adjustments). Without a flavor tag a widescreen
 * DLL and a base DLL for the same overlay collide. The flavor is folded into
 * overlay_abi() (high 16 bits) so the loader's existing ABI gate rejects (and
 * regenerates) any DLL whose flavor differs from the running build's, keeping
 * caches separate even in a shared directory.
 *
 * Base/master MUST stay 0 so the tag == PSX_OVERLAY_ABI_VERSION (backward
 * compatible with all existing base-flavor DLLs). A variant build overrides it
 * (e.g. -DPSX_OVERLAY_FLAVOR=1 for widescreen) for BOTH the runtime and
 * compile_overlays.py (its --flavor arg). */

/* Codegen version — bumped whenever the recompiler emits DIFFERENT bytes for the
 * same guest overlay WITHOUT an ABI change (the load-time overlay_abi() gate only
 * catches ABI/flavor changes; a pure-emitter change produces a different DLL the
 * gate would happily accept). The cache is namespaced by this version
 * (gcc/<arch-abi>/cg<N>/), so a build with new codegen writes + reads a FRESH
 * directory and never reuses a stale DLL; old versions coexist on disk (no
 * auto-delete — a user who downgrades still finds their matching cache). Python
 * (compile_overlays.py) parses this same constant from this header, so the two
 * sides can never drift. BUMP THIS when you change code_generator.cpp emit in a
 * way that alters overlay output (e.g. the auto_screen_x widescreen widening).
 *   1: baseline + auto_screen_x render-funnel cull via psx_ws_cull_sltiu. */
