# The Release build is statically linked (PSX_STATIC_RUNTIME defaults ON for

# those side-by-side was the cause of the 0xc000007b launch crash on user
# machines that had a mismatched copy earlier on the DLL search path.

PSXRecomp $Version

This package does not include a PlayStation BIOS, game disc image, generated
game source, save data, or any copyrighted Sony/game assets.

First launch:
1. Run PSXRecomp.exe.
2. Select your legally obtained SCPH1001.BIN BIOS when prompted.

The selected BIOS path is saved in bios.cfg next to the executable. Delete that
file if you want to pick a different BIOS later.

This framework package is BIOS-only. Game-specific PSXRecomp releases use the
same BIOS picker and additionally prompt for the required game disc image.

Keyboard and Xbox-style controller defaults are documented in README.md.
Controller mappings are configurable in input.ini.

Memory cards are stored in the saves directory.
